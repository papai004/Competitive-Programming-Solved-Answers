2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K

Steps: 
1. sort the array so that adjacent element difference is minimum.
2. let count = 1 because each element is a minimum diff. i.e: 2-2 = 0
3. take a variable min having the first element
4. travarse the array and find if the array element - min > k (because if the last taken sorted value - min value > k then 
we can not take that value and it is a subsequence. so count increased by 1 and new min value will be the current index





















var partitionArray = function (nums, k) {
    const arr = nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 1;
    let min = arr[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] - min > k){
            count++;
            min = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return count;
};
