Approach:
1. Initialize count = 1.
2. Check how many repeated occurance happened and increase the count according to that.


























var possibleStringCount = function(word) {
    let count = 1;
    for(let i=0; i<word.length-1; i++){
        if(word[i] === word[i+1]){
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
